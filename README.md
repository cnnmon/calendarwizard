i use my calendar to track every part of my day, so i made a little mini second brain project to store my calendar events & my todo list.

the website is ready-to-go and hosted at https://wizardingassistant.vercel.app/, but unfortunately google cloud api takes a bit to verify the app is trustworthy. currently, this means this only works out of the box with berkeley emails, but feel free to send me your email and i can add it as a test user.
